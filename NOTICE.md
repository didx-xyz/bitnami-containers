# NOTICE

## About This Repository

This repository is a **redistribution fork** of the [Bitnami Containers](https://github.com/bitnami/containers) project. We provide unmodified, repackaged container images from the official Bitnami open-source containers.

## What We Do

- **Sync**: Automatically sync with the upstream Bitnami containers repository
- **Build**: Create multi-architecture container images (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- **Publish**: Distribute images via GitHub Container Registry at `ghcr.io/{owner}/bitnami-oss/`

## What We DON'T Do

- **Modify code**: We make zero modifications to the Bitnami source code
- **Provide support**: We do not provide technical support for these containers
- **Develop features**: We do not add features or fix bugs

## üö® Important: Where to Get Help

### For Issues, Bugs, or Support

**Please open issues at the official Bitnami repository:**

üëâ **<https://github.com/bitnami/containers>**

We cannot provide support for these container images. All technical issues, feature requests, bug reports, and support questions should be directed to the official Bitnami team.

### For Build/Distribution Issues

If you encounter problems specifically with our automated builds or image distribution (not the containers themselves), you may open an issue in this repository.

- **Nature**: Unmodified redistribution

## Why This Fork Exists

Bitnami stopped publishing open-source container images to public registries, but continues to maintain the source code. This repository bridges that gap by:

1. Automatically syncing with upstream changes
2. Building and publishing the open-source containers
3. Providing multi-architecture support
4. Maintaining proper attribution to the original authors
